# Kafka

## Listeners
**Internal listeners** \
Internal listeners help Kafka communicate within the Kubernetes network

**External listeners** \
External listeners allow connections to Kafka from outside Kubernetes, like from a different network

## JBOD storage
JBOD storage allows you to configure your Kafka cluster to use multiple disks or volumes. This approach provides increased data storage capacity for Kafka brokers, and can lead to performance improvements
